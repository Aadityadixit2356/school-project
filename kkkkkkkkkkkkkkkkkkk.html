<p style="font-size:20px;color: white ;"> It was discovered by Fritz Zwicky in 1941. Zwicky considered his discovery "one of the most complicated structures awaiting its explanation on the basis of stellar dynamics.

An estimation of the galaxy's span resulted in a conclusion of 150,000 light years, slightly smaller than the Andromeda Galaxy. The Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3) measured a D25 isophotal diameter for the Cartwheel Galaxy at about 60.9 arcseconds, giving it a diameter of 44.23 kiloparsecs (144,300 light-years) based on a redshift-derived distance of 132.2 megaparsecs (431 million light-years).

 The galaxy was once a normal spiral galaxy before it apparently underwent a head-on “bullseye” style collision with a smaller companion approximately 200-300 million years prior to how we see the system today. When the nearby galaxy passed through the Cartwheel Galaxy, the force of the collision caused a powerful gravitational shock wave to expand through the galaxy, like a rock being tossed into a sandbed. Moving at high speed, the shock wave swept up and compressed gas and dust, creating a starburst around the galaxy's center portion that went unscathed as it expanded outwards. This explains the bluish ring around the center, brighter portion. It can be noted that the galaxy is beginning to retake the form of a normal spiral galaxy, with arms spreading out from a central core. These arms are often referred to as the cartwheel's “spokes”.</p>
